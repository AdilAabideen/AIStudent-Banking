# AIStudent-Banking

This project is a web-based application for analyzing bank transactions. It allows users to upload a CSV file of their bank transactions, categorizes them, and provides insights such as most expensive transactions, most recurring transactions, total spent, total income, and more. The application integrates with OpenAI to provide personalized financial tips based on the transactions.

## Features

- **CSV Upload**: Users can upload bank statements in CSV format.
- **Transaction Categorization**: Automatically categorizes transactions into Food, Clothes, Enjoyment, Transfers, Bills, Travel, Other, and Income.
- **Financial Insights**:
  - Calculate total spending per category
  - Identify the most recurring transactions
  - Find the most expensive transactions
  - Analyze the most expensive days
  - Summarize total spent and total income
- **AI-Powered Financial Tips**: Uses GPT-4o-mini model to provide personalized financial advice based on spending patterns.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: React (with chart.js for data visualization)
- **Database**: Pandas (for processing CSV data)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for transaction categorization and financial advice
